# Hirz

**House rules for the AI in your home, and your parents'.**

Hirz lets your family decide what Alexa may do on its own, what it must ask about, and what it may never do. It holds a shared model of the people, devices, schedules, energy, and trust relationships in a home, plans against household goals instead of one-off commands, and acts only inside boundaries the household wrote down. The name for that in the architecture docs is *bounded autonomy*.

> Built for the **Build, Ship, Shape: Amazon Developer Hackathon 2026**: Alexa+ track, Ring track (kept only if the Ring sandbox access gate in `ROADMAP.md` item 34 passes), and both mini-challenges, AWS Builder and Open Source. Designed as a startup, not a weekend project: see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for the hackathon cut line and what comes after it.

## Who it's for

The family's household manager: the adult who set up the smart home at their own place and at their parents' place, and who carries the worry for both.

- People reported losing **$3.5 billion to imposter scams in 2025**, nearly one in three fraud reports, and nearly three times the 2020 figure ([FTC, 2026-06-15](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2026/06/ftc-data-show-people-reported-losing-3-point-5-billion-imposter-scams-2025)).
- Fraud losses reported by adults 60 and over rose about fourfold, from about $600 million in 2020 to **$2.4 billion in 2024**, driven largely by losses over $100,000, often to investment scams, romance scams, or impersonations ([FTC, *Protecting Older Consumers 2024–2025*](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/12/ftc-issues-annual-report-congress-agencys-actions-protect-older-adults)).
- **63 million Americans**, about one in four adults, are family caregivers ([AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, *Caregiving in the U.S. 2025*](https://www.aarp.org/press/releases/2025-07-24-new-report-reveals-crisis-point-for-americas-63-million-family-caregivers.html)).

An assistant that can unlock doors and change the thermostat while someone sleeps, in a home you are responsible for but do not live in, needs rules you can read and proof they held. Hirz is **rules, not care**: it does not do medication or health monitoring. It gives that person autonomy inside a boundary at home, and protection at their parents'. It also does not stop scam calls. It gives Mom one simple thing to do: *ask first*.

## What it does

5:05 PM, at Mom's.

> **Mom:** Alexa, Malik just called from a strange number. He says he's in trouble and needs five hundred dollars. Is it really him?
>
> **Alexa (Hirz):** That number isn't one of Malik's, and this looks like a family-impersonation scam. Don't send anything yet. I'm checking with Malik on his own phone.

Malik's phone buzzes: *"Your mom is checking it's really you. Someone called her claiming to be you."* He taps **It wasn't me. I'm fine.**

> **Alexa (Hirz):** Malik's fine. That call wasn't him.

Hirz never used anything the caller said as a fact. It checked the household's own records and asked Malik through a channel the family verified in advance.

5:31 PM, at Malik's. He is just home, and rattled.

> **Malik:** Alexa, from now on, never unlock the door for someone we're not expecting.
>
> **Alexa (Hirz):** I've written that as a rule and sent it to your phone. It won't take effect until you approve it there.

On his phone: one English sentence, a before-and-after line (*Unexpected visitor: ask on phone → never*), the compiled policy underneath. He activates it with his passkey. Anyone in the room can propose a rule. Only a person on their own phone can activate one.

> **Malik:** What's going on tonight?
>
> **Alexa (Hirz):** You're in the peak window until 7. I'll run the house off the battery, warm the living room for your mom, and hold the car until after 9.

The screen shows the plan as a card: what it saves tonight, three rows, one Approve button. He changes it by voice ("don't charge the car past 50, I'm not driving tomorrow") and the plan re-optimizes.

At 6:40 the doorbell rings and nobody is expected. "Let them in."

> **Alexa (Hirz):** You added a rule tonight: I never unlock for someone who isn't expected.

At 7:04 it rings again. A vehicle pulled in at 6:58, and Mom is expected at 7:00. "That's my mom, let her in."

> **Alexa (Hirz):** Unlocking the door needs your approval on your phone. I've sent it.

Same lock, two outcomes. *Never*, because the family said so an hour ago. *Ask*, on a phone, never by voice, because an Echo is a shared device and Alexa does not tell add-ons who is speaking.

Every one of those sentences is backed by a structured record: what Hirz did, why, under which rule of the household constitution, at what risk band, and who approved it. Every number Hirz speaks comes from a cited scenario run. The demo household is on ComEd's published Time-of-Day rate, where the all-in peak price is several times the overnight price; the same evening is also run on ComEd's live hourly feed, and the backtest table below shows both. Nothing here is typed by hand.

| Rate plan (both real ComEd residential rates) | Saving per night | Annualized | Worst spike night avoided | Hours charged at negative prices |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Time-of-Day (published rate table) | *from the backtest, `ROADMAP.md` item 17* | | n/a | n/a |
| Hourly Pricing (live feed, a year of history) | | | | |

## Why existing agents fall short

Alexa+ can now call third-party tools over MCP, orchestrate multi-turn conversations, and render interactive UI. Household agents built on it already follow a common pattern: an allowlist of actions, a human-approval step for the risky ones, and an audit trail. That pattern is necessary and Hirz has it. It is not sufficient, for three reasons:

1. **The boundary is the developer's, not the household's.** An allowlist is written in code by whoever built the agent. A family needs to *write* the answer to "how much authority do you have?" themselves, change it, and see proof that it was enforced somewhere the agent's own code cannot get around.
2. **Trust comes from the caller.** The same channel that takes "turn off the lights" also takes "it's me, I'm in trouble, send money". An assistant with no record of who Malik is and how to reach him can only take the caller's word for it.
3. **One user, one command at a time.** Preferences, routines, people, assets, and constraints live in ten apps and nobody's head. Nothing plans across Mom's comfort, the car's deadline, tonight's prices, and Dad's "kitchen is busy until 11" in one decision, with numbers it can defend.

## What Hirz adds

Approval gates, an audit ledger, and a simulated Alexa+ host are the baseline for a household agent, and Hirz has all three. The four things below are what Hirz adds on top of that baseline.

| | What it is | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **A boundary the household writes, that the home itself enforces** | A Household Constitution, proposed by voice or written as a form, as YAML, or in plain English, and always activated by a person on their own phone. It states per action class and per member what Hirz may do on its own, what it must ask about, and what it may never do. Every version compiles to a Cedar/Dogwood policy set that AgentCore Policy enforces at the AWS tool boundary, including a temporal "approval must precede action" rule. Only a permit gets a command signed, and the home-side agent, Hirz Link, obeys only signed commands. | The boundary belongs to the family, not the developer. Hirz's own processes hold no credential that can act on a device; only commands the policy engine authorized are signed, and the home obeys only signed commands. |
| **Verification from the household's own records** | Trusted contacts have channels verified out of band at setup. A request is checked against those records and confirmed through the subject's own app or verified number, never through anything the caller supplied. A recent scam call plus an unexpected visitor at the door raises a warning. Hirz has no way to move money, by design. | "Is this really Malik?" is answered by the graph, not by the person asking. |
| **A real planner over real prices** | A rolling-horizon MILP schedules the EV, the home battery, HVAC, and appliances against the household's real rate plan (all-in, supply plus delivery) and live weather, per-occupant comfort bands, and member constraints, and reports savings against a baseline plan solved with the same model. A physics twin supplies every device that is not real, labeled as simulated. | The savings on the scorecard are computed, not typed, and the binding constraints and rejected alternatives are outputs of the model rather than a story about it. |
| **Multi-member coordination with provenance** | Each member's constraints and preferences keep their owner and time: "Dad, 22:40: kitchen in use until 23:00" survives into the plan, the explanation, and the audit row. Conflicts between members are returned as data with the people involved, never silently resolved. | A household is not one user. The plan can say whose request moved the dishwasher, and why. |

Underneath all four: a deterministic risk engine whose bands set floors the constitution can tighten but never loosen, and a pipeline in which every action carries what, why, which rule, and what was rejected, as data that Alexa narrates. Those are the mechanisms that make the four hold; they are not the claim.

In local mode there is no outside boundary: the second policy evaluator runs in the same container and is labeled as exactly that. "Enforced outside Hirz" is claimed for the AWS deployment only.

## Architecture

![Hirz loop](./docs/img/loop.svg)

*Observe → Understand → Plan → Evaluate Risk → Check Authority → Act → Verify → Remember. Every action Hirz takes passes through that loop, and every step of it is recorded.*

Every box is a module described in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md). Surfaces talk to Hirz Core only through MCP tools or the companion API; Core talks to the world only through adapters, each of which has a real implementation and a **digital-twin** implementation behind the same interface.

**The decision pipeline, in order.** A proposed action is resolved by one deterministic, ordered pipeline (full detail in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3):

```
1. Identity + role resolution      → unknown requester → least authority
2. Constitution NEVER              → DENY (terminal)
3. Risk floor                      → CRITICAL → DENY or VERIFY (terminal)
4. Constitution mode + conditions  → auto | ask | never
5. Risk band escalation            → HIGH forces ASK even where the constitution says auto
6. Budgets and rate limits         → daily $ limit, action counts → ASK or DENY
7. Boundary enforcement (Cedar)    → AgentCore Policy must agree; disagreement fails closed
8. → EXECUTE | ASK | DENY | VERIFY    (EXECUTE on a home device = a command the boundary signed, verified in the home)
```

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Core | Python 3.12, FastAPI, official `mcp` SDK (FastMCP), async throughout | First-party MCP SDK; same stack as the author's prior MCP work; AgentCore Runtime's MCP contract is Python-first |
| Planner | `scipy.optimize.milp` (HiGHS) rolling-horizon scheduler | Deterministic, explainable, one dependency; no LLM in the optimization loop ([ADR-005](./docs/adr/ADR-005-deterministic-planner.md)) |
| Policy | YAML constitution + Pydantic schema + a non-Turing-complete condition grammar, compiled to Cedar | Git-diffable, validated at load, analyzable; enforced in-process and at the AWS tool boundary ([ADR-003](./docs/adr/ADR-003-constitution-yaml-to-cedar.md)) |
| Risk | Fixed action-class table + dynamic factors, **no ML** | A household decision the family can't explain is one they can't trust ([ADR-004](./docs/adr/ADR-004-no-ml-risk-scoring.md)) |
| Storage | PostgreSQL 16 (household graph, constitution versions, plans, approvals, audit chain) + AgentCore Memory (conversational, preference extraction) | Relational integrity for a hash chain; graph as tables + JSONB ([ADR-002](./docs/adr/ADR-002-postgres-over-dynamodb.md)) |
| Surfaces | React + TypeScript: MCP App cards (`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`, plain CSS carrying Amazon's design tokens), companion app and simulator (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) | The MCP Apps SDK and the Alexa tooling are TypeScript ([ADR-001](./docs/adr/ADR-001-python-core-typescript-surfaces.md)); the cards follow Amazon's add-on design guide verbatim ([`docs/design.md`](./docs/design.md)) |
| Home agent | Hirz Link: a small Python process beside Home Assistant, outbound-only, executes only KMS-signed commands | The Home Assistant token never leaves the house, no tunnel, and a bypass in Hirz's own processes has nothing to act with ([ADR-009](./docs/adr/ADR-009-signed-commands-home-agent.md)) |
| Open source | A separate repository: an add-on conformance checker (CLI, black-box against any MCP server) and the simulator's generic host harness | Every entrant builds an emulated host and none is faithful; Hirz's simulator is built on the published harness and its CI runs the checker |
| Alexa+ | MCP 2025-11-25, Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1 + PKCE S256, Protected Resource Metadata, MCP Apps for visuals | The add-on contract, verbatim ([ADR-007](./docs/adr/ADR-007-alexa-surface-strategy.md)) |
| AWS | AgentCore Runtime, Gateway, Policy, Memory, Identity; Bedrock (Claude Haiku 4.5 / Sonnet 5; the emulator runs Haiku 4.5 by default with Nova Lite selectable); EventBridge Scheduler + Lambda; KMS (command signing); S3 Object Lock (audit anchors); CDK (TypeScript) | AWS runs Hirz's agentic state and enforcement, not just its hosting ([ADR-008](./docs/adr/ADR-008-agentcore-topology.md)) |
| Twin | Physics-lite models with a simulated clock and a YAML scenario DSL | Everything is demonstrable end to end with no hardware, and every scenario is an integration test ([ADR-006](./docs/adr/ADR-006-twin-first-adapters.md)) |
| Ops | Docker Compose (Postgres, Home Assistant demo, Hirz), OpenTelemetry → CloudWatch via AgentCore Observability, GitHub Actions (ruff / mypy strict / pytest 80% gate / tsc / vitest / playwright) | |

## Quickstart (target state, see `ROADMAP.md` Phase 0)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BashaarJavaid/Hirz && cd Hirz
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d          # Postgres 16 + Home Assistant (demo devices) + Hirz
uv sync && uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run hirz scenario run scenarios/demo-evening.yaml --speed 60   # the whole evening in 3 minutes
open http://localhost:3000                       # companion app + simulator
```

During the judging window there is also a hosted demo: one click seeds a throwaway household on simulated devices only, so nothing needs installing (the link is in the Devpost testing instructions). No AWS account is required for the local path. `HIRZ_LLM=off` runs every flow deterministically with canned explanations, which is what CI uses and what a judge with no credentials can run.

## How this is built

Hirz is built by one engineer working with AI coding assistants. The design decisions are the human's: the thesis, the four things Hirz adds, the decision pipeline and its precedence, the fail-closed posture, the choice to keep the risk engine free of ML and the constitution non-Turing-complete, the twin-first adapter strategy, and every rejected alternative in `docs/adr/`. The assistants implement downstream of those decisions under the standing rules in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md): surface assumptions, ask before deciding, no speculative complexity, verify every feature by running it.

Nothing in this README is asserted on a model's say-so. Where something is simulated it is labeled as a twin in the UI and in the docs. Where something is unproven or unprotected, `THREAT_MODEL.md` says so.
